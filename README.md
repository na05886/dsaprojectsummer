Called the COVID-19 Health App, this program helps users to find the shortest distance between their current location and the covid health centre that they wish to visit. Morever, the program has a quarantine mode where user can input the time (in hours) and the program will tell it what routine it should follow according to that specific time. It also has three special days, Tuesday is Delivery of quarantine supplies, Friday is COVID-19 test day and Sunday is Medcine delivery day. Run the program, enter your name, the time in hours, the day of the week (if in quarantine mode) and the enter the initial and final locations of your destinantion.
